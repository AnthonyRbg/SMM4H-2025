Chief Complaint:
fever, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 41 y/o M with history of recently diagnosed
HIV infection (VL > 100,000, CD4 pending), depression/anxiety,
and gonococcal infections of pharynx and anus who presents 2
days after discharge from recent admission with recurrent fever
up to 103.8. The patient was admitted from [**3-29**] to [**4-1**] with
fevers to 102 and acute renal failure. During that admission,
his renal failure resolved with IVF, and his fever workup was
remarkable for positive ASO titer without symptoms of
pharyngitis for which he was discharged on augmentin. He was
discharged on [**4-1**] at which time he felt fairly well. He
continues to have joint pains diffusely for which he is taking
oxycodone and tylenol. The patient has been taking his
medications, including augmentin, as prescribed.
.
The morning prior to this admission pt felt somewhat unwell with
""red eyes"" and missed his augmentin dose. At that time his
temperature was 101.2. He thinks that he took one bactrim pill
by mistake as well as 6 ibuprofen but continued to feel poorly.
His temperature increased to 103.8 at which time he came to the
emergency room. Patient was reported to have a rash, but on
interview in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient denied having any rash but
thought his skin was somewhat red from his fever. He admitted to
a frontal headache located just supraorbitally which has been
ongoing since last week; he also had sinus congestion. He denied
cough, ear pain or fullness, visual difficulty, sore throat,
difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, nausea or vomiting,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, and penile lesions or
discharge. He denied neck stiffness as well as
numbness/tingling/weakness of the extremities.
.
In the ED, VS T 102.5 HR 131 BP 110/50 O2 97% RA. His blood
pressure did fluctuate from a low of ~ 90 systolic up to 110. He
received a total of 7 L of IVF. Lactate was 2.8. Blood cultures
were drawn and an LP was performed which showed 3 WBCs (69%
polys, 22% lymphs), 0 RBCs, protein 45, glucose 53. He was
treated with ceftriaxone 2 g IV X 1, vancomycin 1 g IV X 1, and
acyclovir 800 mg IV X 1; for his rash, he was treated with
solumedrol 125 mg X 1 and benadryl. Imaging studies revealed
normal CXR and CT was negative for incranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.
.
Pt was subsequently admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for borderline
hypotension. In the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt was started on azithyromycin for
sinusitis. He was continued on ceftriaxone for presumed
pneumonia based on RML infiltrate on poor CXR. He had extensive
work up for fever during the recent admission and not source has
been found at present. His hypotension responded to fluid and
[**Last Name (un) 104**] stim was adequate. Pt was subsequently transferred to the
floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Fever: Patient had no focal signs or symptoms of infection.
DFA negative for influenza.  I suspect his fever is due to acute
HIV versus possible Lyme disease.  Known HIV with viral load >
100,000. CD4 count came back during this admission at 180.
Patient was initially covered with empiric ceftriaxone and
azithromycin in the ICU without clear source.  LP was negative.
Throat cultures were negative.  CXR was most consistent with
volume overload (received 7 liters NS in ED alone).  Urinalysis
without evidence for infection and blood cultures remain no
growth to date.  CMV viral load pending but normal LFTs and no
diarrhea.  Recent extensive work-up during his prior admission
was unrevealing, however his Lyme antibody came back positive.
ID was consulted and agreed with empiric treatment with
doxycycline x 30 day.  They also suggested ruling out PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] low suspicion given his low CD4 count.  However,
patient denied any cough and was unable to provide sputum,
including with induction.  Bronchoscopy was not pursued given
very low suspicion.  Patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2392**] and
this can be reconsidered if CXR or O2 sat worsens.
.
# Newly diagnosed HIV:  CD4 < 200.  Given bactrim allergy,
patient was started on atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  G6PD was
sent.  If normal, could start dapsone for prophylaxis instead
given this is pill form and only once daily.  He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2392**] to discuss starting HAART.
.
# Hypotension: Again, patient hypotensive in the setting of his
fever.  His blood pressure improved with aggressive hydration.
AM cortisol was normal.  Patient has been hemodynamically stable
on the floor.
.
# Joint pain: Resolved prior to discharge.  In conjunction with
conjunctivitis, could be reactive due to inflammatory process
such as acute HIV or other viral syndrome.  Also concerning for
possible Lyme - getting treated with 30 days of doxycycline.
[**Doctor First Name **] and RF negative on last admission.
.
# Conjunctival injection: Patient noted to have similar symptoms
on his last admission, likely viral conjunctivitis. However,
given he is a contact lens wearer, he was started on cipro eye
gtt and this symptom significantly improved.  He will continue
these drops for 5 days total.
.
# Rash: Patient was noted to have a diffuse erythroderma which
is not concerning to him or causing any symptoms at present.
Likely secondary to HIV seroconversion rash versus allergy to
bactrim which he took prior to admission. Could also be related
to Lyme.  It resolved prior to discharge.
.
# Anemia: High ferritin on last admission suggests more likely
anemia of chronic disease.  Iron supplement discontinued.
.
# Depression/Anxiety: Patient was contined on his home dose
celexa, klonopin and temazepam prn.
.
# Dispo: Patient discharged to home

Service:  Neurology

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 48749**] is a 49-year-old
man diagnosed with neurosarcoid in a previous neurologic
admission who was recently discharged to rehabilitation on
[**5-11**] after extensive workup for neurosarcoid.  In
rehabilitation he was doing well and was ambulating with and
without a walker.  On [**2173-5-15**], he was prematurely
changed from IV steroids to po Medrol.  Since then, he has
been deteriorating rapidly to the point that he awoke on the
day of admission, and was not able to move his legs at all.

He had breakthrough pain in his lower back and exacerbation
of this allodynia in his feet and legs.  When he was
initially seen in the Emergency Room, he was tearful with
feelings of hopelessness, very upset about his condition.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  His vital signs were stable.  He
is alert, awake, oriented and tearful.  Normal name and
repetition, comprehension was intact.  Months of the year
backwards and forwards were normal.  Cranial nerves were
intact.  Extraocular movements were full.  Face is symmetric.
Tongue was midline.  Palate elevates symmetrically.  Shoulder
shrug was normal.  He had decreased strength in his lower
extremities, 0/5 and full [**5-24**] in his upper extremities.  His
sensory:  Decreased sensation to C6-T1 pin prick in his upper
extremities and deep tendon reflexes were 0/4 in the upper
extremities, trace brachioradialis.  Proprioception was
decreased in his fingers, wrist, and elbow at the level of
the shoulders.  In his lower extremities, he had severe
decrease in sensation, decreased pin prick, light touch,
vibratory, and cold from T7 down, worse on the left side.

He was seen and admitted for acute worsening of his lower
extremity weakness.  He decided to order a MRI of the spine
which is unchanged from before, and we changed the steroids
to 1 gram IV q day, Solu-Medrol x5 days, and had Rheumatology
consult to discuss these use of other immunomodulatory
agents.  He had severe pain and at first we increased his
methadone and Neurontin, and started a Morphine PCA pump.  We
had him on pantoprazole GI prophylaxis, and watched him
closely on the neurologic service.

Over the coming days with his movement and pain was somewhat
better controlled, Rheumatology saw him and agreed with
Solu-Medrol, and then felt that he would also benefit from
steroids after that as well.  He was watched closely on the
Neurologic service, and PCA pump was working well to control
his pain.

On [**5-20**], he was found by the Neurology Service to be
minimally responsive.  He was given naloxone with much
benefit.  He continued to be less responsive and was not
following commands.  We transferred him to the Intensive Care
Unit for further observation on [**5-20**] as well as a STAT
electroencephalogram was performed.  This
electroencephalogram showed a mild encephalopathy, but was
negative for seizures.  He was monitored and his respiratory
distress was watched closely.  Initially, his respirations
were [**6-27**], however, in the coming hours, he improved and was
able to breathe in regular rate 12-15 breathes/minute, and
his neurologic status improved.  It was felt that his acute
change in mental status was attributed to his increased pain
medications especially his PCA pump.

He was transferred back to the floor the following day.  IV
steroids and Solu-Medrol were continued, and a full course
was given in five days.  Again Rheumatology recommended to
continue Imuran 50 mg q day as well as continue 1.2 mg of
Medrol IV divided in [**Hospital1 **] dosages.  They also recommended that
infliximab may be used 5 mg/kg IV x1, and after the IV
steroids were completed, and then two weeks later as well as
six weeks after that.  I discussed this with the entire
Neurology team as well as other consulting services.

We also discussed the issue of a positive PPD with Infectious
Disease and given that we were giving him infliximab and high
dosed steroids, we may need to be more aggressive with his
anti-TB prophylactic treatment.  They felt that INH was
sufficient and he would just have to be monitored closely.
He was also given a bowel regimen of Senna, Dulcolax, and
Colace, and he was able to control his bowels as well.

He was found to have a urinary tract infection with some
blood in his urine, and he was started on Levaquin 500 mg po
q day.  He will continue this as an outpatient as well.  His
pain was controlled on his gabapentin, nortriptyline,
Percocet, and methadone and his leg shaking was controlled on
increasing doses of primidone tapered up to 225 mg po tid.

Over the few days before his discharge, he had increasing leg
strength, and was able to abduct his legs for the first time
since admission.  He remains clinically stable.  We
discontinued the Foley the day prior to admission, and he
urinated nine hours later 500 cc.  He continued to have
hyperesthesia in his bilateral lower extremities and his
strength was returning slowly.  He was deemed stable for
discharge to rehabilitation on [**5-26**] with followup in the
[**Hospital 878**] Clinic as well as followup in the Pheresis Unit at
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital for his infliximab treatment.  He was
seen and followed up with Psychiatry and his mood was better.
He stated he was hanging in there and doing well.  They felt
that we should continue with Celexa 40 mg and consider using
Seroquel 25-50 mg q hs for sleep instead of Ambien.

On discharge, he was much improved.  Social Work as well as
other services met with him.  Social Work helped him with
[**Social Security Number 48750**]social security disability benefit forms, and relayed
information.  Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy were
.................... for rehabilitation.

ADDENDUM TO PREVIOUS DISCHARGE SUMMARY:  The remainder of the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital stay was uneventful.  His mental status
continued to improve daily.  The patient worked with the
Physical Therapy Service and was able to ambulate with
minimal assistance.  Per the Physical Therapy Service's
recommendations, it was decided that the patient would
benefit from an acute rehabilitation stay.  After an
extensive discussion with the family, several appropriate
options were found.  The patient was discharged in stable
condition to rehabilitation facility.  Please see the

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8115**]
Chief Complaint:
Right facial swelling



Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 yo F with PMH significant for Breast CA with last
chemotherapy on [**12-16**] (Taxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin)
with an ANC 686 now with increased right sided facial swelling,
erythema, warmth, and pain for 1 day.

The pt was in her usual state of health until 1 week prior when
she began to notice oral lesions occuring over the lips and on
the oral mucosa.  These lesions were painful and were limiting
PO intake.  She was reportedly perscribed Acyclovir by her
oncologist to treat presumed HSV infection, however she never
filled the perscription.  Over the course of the week the
lesions largely improved with decreased pain and erythema.
However, on the morning of admission she awoke with right-sided
facial swelling, redness, and pain.  She felt feverish and her
temperature measured at home was 100.9.  She called her
oncologist who recomended that she go to the ED.

Of note, Pt reports change in vision in the right eye which
started 3 days before admission.  She reports a ""wavey line"" in
her field of view.  It does not interfere with her acuity, she
denies diplopia, pain with movement, seeing halos, and
associated headaces.

Also of note, pt noted diarrhea begining on Monday, which
largely resolved by Wednesday.  On Friday she was started on
Cipro and since then diarrhea has completely resolved.

In the ED Febrile to 101.7, HR 126, 175/90 RR 18 SpO2 99%RA.  Pt
received Unasyn and Penacillin G.  Pt reported substernal Chest
pain along with sinus tachycardia that subsided as tachycardia
resolved. Facial swellin was evaluated with CT face, which was
concerning for subcutaneous air,raising concern for necrotizing
process.  ENT evaluation found oral lesions which may be
responsible for the entrance of air into her facial soft tissue
structures.  ID was conslted, and recommended daptomycin,
meropenem, and clindamycin.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 year old female with PMH significant for Breast CA with last
chemotherapy on [**12-16**] (Taxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin) and
ANC on admission of 686 presenting  with increased right facial
cellulitis.  Patient initially admitted to MICU for management
given borderline low neutrophil count along with possible
nectrotizing fascitis of right face. Hospital course by problem:

#. Facial Swelling due to HSV :  This was initially thought to
be a cellulitis.  ENT was consulted regarding air in soft
tissues of right cheek seen on CT scan.  ENT believed that this
air was due to tracking from open sores in right oral mucosa.
ID was also consulted and patient was placed on daptomycin for
Gram-positive coverage, Meropenem for GRN and anaerobe coverage,
and Clindamycin to limit toxin production if indeed this was a
toxin-mediated cellulitis or necrotizing process. Facial
erythema improved on 2nd day of admission. ANC also increased to
2590.  Patient was then transferred to the medicine floor. A
repeat CT sinus showed interval improvement with no abscess. Pt
was noted to develop oral lesions, and n HSV culture of her oral
lesions was performed. Given concern of ophthalmic involvement
of a possible HSV outbreak, ophtho was consulted, and there was
no concern for eye involvement. She was empirically started on a
course of acyclovir. In-house bacterial cultures were all
negative, so she was discharged with VNA services for
antibiotics (clinda/dapto), with close ID followup. Of note, her
lower lip viral culture performed [**12-28**] did return as positive for
HSV type I several days after her discharge.
.
# CAD:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5700**] had a complaint of substernal, nonradiating
Chest pain in the Emergency Department.  Given her history of
CAD with stents to the LAD and LCx; It is likely that in the
setting of sinus tachycardia, she had some anginal symptoms.
EKG was without significant ischemic changes and cardiac enzymes
were negative x 3.
Home Aspirin and Lipitor were continued while in the hospital.
Atenolol was briefly held due to an episode of hypotension, but
was restarted without hypotension. She may benefit from
outpatient stress testing.
.
# chronic diastolic CHF:  Pt has history of CHF for which she
takes lasix at home. Echo from [**2186-10-13**] shows mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%), so CHF is presumably [**1-27**] diastolic
dysfunction. Held home lasix briefly because of hypotension, but
was restarted at home dose prior to d/c.
.
#. Hypertension: Patient had one episode of hypotension on
admission which responded to IVF bolus.  Antihypertensives were
initially held and were restarted on the floor without further
episodes of hypotension.
.
# Breast Cancer: management deferred to outpatient oncology
team. Of note, she did receive herceptin while in-house.
.
# DM type 1: continued home insulin [**Month/Day (2) 4581**] with [**Last Name (un) **] following.
.
# Depression/Anxiety: continued home dose effexor, wellbutrin,
clonazepam, and ativan

# Hyperlipidemia:  continued lipitor

# GERD: Patient takes omeprazole at home, she was given
pantoprazole while in the hospital

# Hypothyroidism:  continued home dose levothyroxine

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with facial cellulitis
(infection of the tissue below the skin). We started you on
broad antibiotic coverage to treat the infection. We looked at
your mouth, blood, urine, and stool, and could not find a bug
that caused the infection
.
We had our infectious disease doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 788**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and they initially
had you on broad spectrum antibiotics. Since you were afebrile
your repeat CT scan looked much better, we narrowed you
antibiotics down to 2 medicines. You will be discharged with VNA
to come to your house and administer the 1 antibiotics that is
given IV.
.
You also began to develop lesions on your lip that look like
they might be viral. We tested them but they did not grow any
virus. Nonetheless, we are beginning you on an antiviral
medicine called acyclovir, which you should take for 7 days as
prescribed.
.
Please keep all your followup appointments. Please take all
medicines as prescribed. If you experience any symptoms that
disturb you, such as fevers/chills, worsening facial or eye
pain, or problems with your vision, please call your doctor or
go to the ED.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bright red blood per rectum.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old female
with history of hypertension, diabetes type 2, and
diverticulosis by colonoscopy in [**7-10**], who presents with
large volume of BRBPR x2 this a.m.  The patient was unclear
about amount of bleeding, but quantifies it as cupfuls.  She
had 2 more episodes in the ED with 1 episode about 200 cc [**Name8 (MD) **]
RN.  In the ED, her hematocrit was noted to be 37.2 (baseline
36 to 37) and hemodynamically stable with blood pressure
129/88 and pulse 95.  Unfortunately, she failed NG lavage.
She has never had prior GI bleeding and denied chest pain,
shortness of breath, lightheadedness, abdominal pain,
nausea/vomiting, palpitations, recent fevers and chills,
recent NSAID use, GERD, anticoagulation, ETOH.  She received
1.5 liters of normal saline following resuscitation in ED and
was transferred to the floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

NIDDM.

Diverticulosis with no history of GI bleed (colonoscopy,
[**7-10**], showing diverticula of sigmoid and descending colon
and grade 1 internal hemorrhoids, otherwise normal to cecum).

Seborrheic keratosis.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission,
1. Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2. KCl 20 mEq p.o. q.d.
3. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Prazosin 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Moexipril 15 mg p.o. q.d.
6. MDI.
7. Calcium carbonate.


ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN WITH UNCLEAR REACTION.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 96323**] with husband
(who is currently hospitalized in Rehab Center with CVA), no
tobacco or ETOH.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs, blood
pressure 124/79, pulse 74, respirations 18, 97 percent on
room air with blood pressure and pulse changing to 99/58 with
pulse of 81 during course of examination.  General:  NAD,
resting on the stretcher, alert and oriented x3.  HEENT:
PERRLA, EOMI, MMM, clear oropharynx, anicteric sclerae.
Neck:  Supple, no JVD, no lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs,
or gallop.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  No
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, 2 plus PT pulses.  Rectal:
Skin tag at anus with bright red blood noted, good sphincter
tone.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, significant for white count
of 4.3 with 16 neutrophils, 33 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes, 4
eosinophils.  Hematocrit 37.2, platelets 311.  Chemistry is
notable for BUN 26, creatinine 0.9.

On [**2140-5-16**], ECG, normal sinus rhythm at 79 beats per minute,
normal axis and intervals, left atrial enlargement, frequent
PACs, no ST-T wave changes from prior ECG.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Bright red blood per rectum.  Patient was
typed and crossed for several units of packed red cells and
was ensured adequate peripheral IV access and given normal
saline for volume resuscitation.  Over the course of the
evening, she had several more episodes of hematochezia while
attempting to prep for colonoscopy for the following day.
Her hematocrit dropped to 24 over the next several hours and
the patient was sent for packed red blood cell scan given the
active bleeding.  This localized the area of bleeding to the
distal transverse colon just proximal to the splenic flexure.
She was then immediately sent to angiography, which
unfortunately was unable to localize the bleed.  She was
monitored in the MICU for the next several days and
transfused several units of packed red cells for continually
decreasing hematocrit.  She had a colonoscopy on [**2140-5-17**]
showing extensive diverticulosis in the entire colon, though
more concentrated in the left colon, and fresh blood in the
rectosigmoid colon to about 50 cm from the anal verge, but
most concentrated from about 40 to 50 cm and no bleeding
proximally.  While fresh blood was continually seen, no
specific bleeding diverticulum was identified.  She
stabilized over the next few days and continued on IV
Protonix, though the most likely source of bleeding was from
the sigmoid or descending colon, secondary to diverticulosis.
After her hematocrit stabilized with no further episodes of
hematochezia, the patient was transferred to the floor and
prepared for discharge.  Surgery had evaluated the patient
earlier, but did not wish to operate  at this time.  However,
we discussed with the patient that these episodes were likely
to recur and should they recur surgery may be indicated in
the future.

Anemia.  The patient was transfused a total of 8 units of
packed red blood cells during this admission.  She was
started on iron supplements on discharge.

NIDDM.  She was on sliding scale insulin, but will restart
her p.o. hypoglycemics on discharge.

Prophylaxis.  The patient will not need to continue PPI at
home as unlikely to have upper GI lesions.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Diverticulosis.

Lower gastrointestinal bleed.

Hypertension.

Diabetes, non-insulin dependent.

Internal hemorrhoids.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2. KCl 20 mEq p.o. q.d.
3. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Prazosin 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Moexipril 15 mg p.o. q.d.
6. MDI.
7. Calcium carbonate.
8. Iron 325 mg 1 tablet p.o. t.i.d.
9. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.


FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient was advised to follow up with
her primary care doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3649**], in the next few days.
She was advised from the GI team to eat a high-fiber diet,
but that these episodes may recur.  She was instructed to
return to the Emergency Department immediately should she
experience any further bright red blood per rectum.
