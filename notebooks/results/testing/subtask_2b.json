The patient reports that she awoke from sleep\nwith shortness of breath, orthopnea which has been getting\nprogressively worse.  At baseline she has some dyspnea on\nexertion with mild to moderate exertion.  It occurs with one\nflight of stairs.  She now is complaining of shortness of\nbreath at rest.  She reports she also is having increasing\nlower extremity edema for the last several weeks which had\nresponded to increasing doses of Lasix orally, initially 40\nmg p.o. b.i.d., then 60 mg p.o. b.i.d., however, this was no\nlonger helping.  She was also complaining of fatigue and\nseveral weeks of difficulty sleeping secondary to orthopnea.\nShe denies chest pain, cough, fever and chills.  She has had\nno other change in medications recently, no change in her\ndiet, no history of coronary artery disease.  The patient\nreports decreasing urine output for over the last four days.\nNo hematuria or dysuria.  No calf pain and no upper\nrespiratory symptoms.  In the Emergency Department the\npatient was noted to be hypoxic with an oxygen saturation in\nthe mid 80s on room air.  She was 94% on 100% nonrebreather.\nHer chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.\nShe was given Lasix 100 mg intravenously with clear urine\noutput around 280 cc and no change in symptoms."

EKG showed ST depressions in leads V4 and V5 at that time.  The patient was given beta blockes, and heart rate came back down to the 100s, and EKG reverted to normal with resolution of ST depressions in leads V4 through V5.  The patient was monitored on telemetry without any major events, with the exception of occasional nonsustained ventricular tachycardia roughly 4 beats in length occurring 2-3 times a day.  The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction; however, the patient's enzymes were elevated.  The troponin-T peaked at 0.13.  During this time, the patient denied any chest pain, and had no EKG changes.  Enzymes were followed and gradually trended down, without intervention, to 0.05.  The patient was also ruled out for intracranial hemorrhage, given his unwitnessed fall.  A head CT was negative.  Orthostatics were negative."
